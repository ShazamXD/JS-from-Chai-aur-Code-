// NOTE: the main difference between for-of and for-in loop is that for-of loops direct values deta hai means loops over only values of iterable object while 
// for-in loop key/indexes of an object


// MAP is not iterable in for-in loop because A Map is not a plain object with enumerable properties â€” it stores data internally in a special structure,
// not as normal keys.
